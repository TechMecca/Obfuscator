# Obfuscator

Lightweight CMake + Python tool that applies **junk-code injection** and **string obfuscation** to selected C/C++ sources during your build. Obfuscation is **opt-in** and scoped via whitelist/exclude so you control exactly where it applies.

---

## Features
- üß± Junk-code injection 
- üîê String obfuscation for string literals (encode at build, decode at runtime)
- üéØ Scoped via `--whitelist` and `--exclude`
- üõ†Ô∏è Works with Visual Studio / Ninja / Make through CMake
- üêç Python CLI with dry-run or in-place writes

---

## Requirements
- CMake
- C++ toolchain (MSVC / Clang / GCC)
- Python 3.x

---

## Quick Start
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TechMecca/Obfuscator.git
cd Obfuscator
cmake -S . -B out/build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build out/build --config Release
```

> Visual Studio (Windows): open the folder in **VS 2022** (CMake project) or choose a preset like `x86-release`.

---

## Usage

**Script path:** `External/Script/obfuscate.py`

Show all options (including string-obfuscation flags):
```bash
python External/Script/obfuscate.py --help
```

Dry run (no file writes):
```bash
python External/Script/obfuscate.py Obfuscator
```

Apply in place with scoping (example):
```bash
python External/Script/obfuscate.py Obfuscator --write   --whitelist src Include   --exclude src/hmac src/SHA
```

Windows (PowerShell):
```powershell
python .\External\Script\obfuscate.py .\Obfuscator --write `
  --whitelist src Include `
  --exclude src\hmac src\SHA
```

> **String obfuscation:** enable/configure it with the script‚Äôs flags shown in `--help` (e.g., scheme, keying, exclusions).

---

## Tips
- Commit before running with `--write` so you can review diffs or revert.
- Keep hot paths (crypto/tight loops) out of the whitelist.
- Re-runs should be idempotent (no repeated mangling).

---

## Troubleshooting

**`SyntaxError: Non-UTF-8 code starting with '\x96'`**  
Your Python file isn‚Äôt UTF-8 (often Windows-1252). Fix one of these ways:

- **Resave as UTF-8** in your editor and replace ‚Äúsmart‚Äù quotes/dashes with ASCII.
- **Temporary workaround** ‚Äî add this at the top of `obfuscate.py`:
  ```python
  # -*- coding: cp1252 -*-
  ```

Changes not appearing?  
- Ensure `--write` is used.  
- Verify whitelist/exclude paths (names/separators/casing).  
- Confirm the transformation you expect is implemented (junk-code vs string obfuscation).

## Roadmap
- Additional string schemes (per-file keys, mixed transforms)
- More injection patterns beyond I/O paths
- Config file support (YAML/JSON)
- Per-file opt-out via comment pragmas
- Unit tests for transformation rules
